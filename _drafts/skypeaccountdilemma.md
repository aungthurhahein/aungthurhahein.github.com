Lost a Skype account in a black hole

It seems that I was using 2 Skype accounts for a while without realizing because I rarely use it and I only do for conference remote meetings. The first account is created with GMail as user and The second account is logging in with Microsoft account. 

The problem comes from Skype usernames. All my emails have the same name such as abc@gmail.com, and abc@hotmail.com. The Skype username is "abc" for both of them and the registered phone number is also the same.
