# Reading list for 2016

At the end of 2014, I wrote a blog post about list of books to read within 2014. I finished some of them and I added more books and swap some out from the list. As for 2015, my life is full with work, thesis writing and can't spend much time reading books. However,I finished reading few books and let do a quick review on them.

### Books read in 2015

> This is a must read book for software developers and programmers who needs tips and guidances about career, developement and so on. It is well organized and easy to follow. 

> As for formal knowledge about basic principles of Digital Forensic, "Handbook of Digital Forensics and Investigation" is a good starter point.

> The second book is called "Art of Memory Analysis" by Volatility team. I read this book as a reference on my thesis writing for Digital Forensic memory analysis concepts and principles.

> Another one is the book I forced myself to read. It's called "Linux Annoyances for Geeks". For a deep understanding of Linux Operating system, this is one book to skim.
 

>The third one is "Me Talk Pretty One Day" by David Sedaris. After David Thorne, I found this guy full with humours and sarcastic thoughts. If you like reading comedy book about life in general, check books from this guy.

> Another guy is also hilarious in his own way. I like his stand-up comedy and also his writing. Dad Is Fat Jim Gaffigan
