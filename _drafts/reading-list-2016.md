# Reading list for 2016

At the end of 2014, I wrote a blog post about list of books to read within 2014. I finished some of them and I added more books and swap some out from the list. As for 2015, my life is full with work, thesis writing and can't spend much time reading books. However,I finished reading few books and let do a quick review on them.

> This is a must read book for software developers and programmers who needs tips and guidances about career, developement and so on. It is well organized and easy to follow. 

I am glad that I made a plan and stick to the list. Before listing books for upcoming year.
