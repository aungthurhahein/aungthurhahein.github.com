### What is Linux Kernel
When we are saying Linux, we are talking about Linux Kernel. It is responsible for various tasks including management of I/O, process and file. To make analogy with a mobile vehicle, there are many cars model such as salon, van, sedan and so on. All Linux distros are like these car models. Some are robust and tough. Some looks nice but slow. Linux Kernel is like a circuit board that control hardware parts of the car and the dashboard,which the user can control the vehicle. Obviously, users are the one who driving the vehicle to get the destinations.    

### Where is Linux Kernel
On the HDD, it can be found at **/vmlinuz**. The source code of Linux kernel can be found at [Linux kernel source tree](https://github.com/torvalds/linux). If you are wondering what these directories present, please check this article:[Linux Kernel Sources](http://tldp.org/LDP/tlk/sources/sources.html).
