I visited to a flea market event at bkk called [Made by Legacy *Warn:FB Redirect*](https://www.facebook.com/MadeByLegacy/) out of curiosity and want to experience chill vibe and atmosphere. The event has a small entry fee and provides you will mobile toilet and hipster decoration (things that make you think of 80s & 90s and plants of course). I am thinking about a few week what make hipster culture and the reality of it.
    
-   There is a huge divide between hipster class: rich one that buys old trash t-shirt for a shit load of money and the poor one who collecting things with almost zero cost
-   They style themselves weird looking clothes and hairstyle from way back or they teleported from that particular time.
-   Mustache is a must.
-   You must love plants and catcus. 
-   Cost Efficiency is not a legitimate concept in hipster world.
-   Hi-fi or Lofi...pick one. Phone audio is bullshit.
-   Lomography is not a joke. 
-   Beer and Black Cofee (B&B) is their choice of drink.
