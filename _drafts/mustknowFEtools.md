This is the first thing when we need to make a decision every time a new project initiates. There are tons of CSS and Javascript frameworks but the ones in the front row are Bootstrap, Foundation, Modernizr, Jquery, Angular, Backbone, Meteor, Ember and React. As for front-end developer, it's essential to familiar with Javascript with Jquery and at least 1 CSS framework.

How to learn: 

### Editors/IDE
What kind of text editors/IDEs front-end develoeprs prefer? 3 Things I think we like to see in editors/IDEs. **Fast, Plugins and Beautiful**. There are not lots of options available and pick one that get you;

* Sublime Text 3 : Don't need much introduction. The most beloved text editor. (Free-ish)
* ATOM: Github hackable editor. (Free)
* WebStrom: a web platform editor from Jetbrains. (Paid)
* Brackets: Abode text editor with integrated (Free)
* LightTable: Text editors with inline evaluation and other cool features (Free)

It's impossible to say which one is the best since it's more of personal perference. For me, I use ST3 manily and LightTable for some interactive coding with Python and Julia.

### Version Control Systems
