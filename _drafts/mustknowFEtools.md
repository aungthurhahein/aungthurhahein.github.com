As for web workers, changes of Technology is dynamic and at the same time, we need to catch up the right tools,concepts and technology to create beautiful working web products. This is not another blog post that gonna say 'use this/use that and why'. It's more about technology that web workers need to get a hand-on to make life easy and boost the productivity.

The tools & technology can be categorized by its purpose in the development process as the following:

1. Frameworks
2. Editors/IDE
3. Version Control Systems
4. Preprocessors
5. Package Managers
6. Task Runners
7. Testing Tools
8. Development Methodology & Architecture
9. Linters
10. Language Reference Tools
11. Learning and training Resources 
12. Typography Tools
13. Productivity Tools

### Frameworks
This is the first thing when we need to make a decision every time a new project initiates. There are tons of CSS and Javascript frameworks but the ones in the front row are Bootstrap, Foundation, Modernizr, Jquery, Angular, Backbone, Meteor, Ember and React. As for front-end developer, it's essential to familiar with Javascript with Jquery and at least 1 CSS framework.

### Editors/IDE
What kind of text editors/IDEs front-end develoeprs prefer? 3 Things I think we like to see in editors/IDEs. **Fast, Plugins and Beautiful**. There are not lots of options available and pick one that get you;

* Sublime Text 3 : Don't need much introduction. The most beloved text editor. (Free-ish)
* ATOM: Github hackable editor. (Free)
* WebStrom: a web platform editor from Jetbrains. (Paid)
* Brackets: Abode text editor with integrated (Free)
* LightTable: Text editors with inline evaluation and other cool features (Free)

It's impossible to say which one is the best since it's more of personal preference. For me, I use ST3 manily and LightTable for some interactive coding with Python and Julia. 

### Version Control Systems
There are 7 major [version control systems](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/09/the-top-7-open-source-version-control-systems/).Git,Mercurial and SVN is the most popular systems and Git might be the major systems most orgranization and develoepers exercise. It is essential to familiar with **Git** and Git software platforms such as **Github** or **Bitbucket**.

### Preprocessors
When we are talking about preprocessors in Front-End development, we are refering to Syntactic preprocessors,which stands in between the Prorgramming Language and the programmer. It interprets its specific language into the destinated language to improve the structure, organization and productivity. The most popular CSS preprocessors and **SaSS**, **LESS** and **Stylus**. I personally prefer Sass because of its syntax and structure. As for Javascript preprocessors, Coffescript and TypeScipt rules over the rest of the preprocessors.
