### Miniature Calendar
This mini-project started from another design project called <a href="http://miniature-calendar.com/">Miniature Calendar</a>. It's a beautiful creative project, which creates real world scenes with small scaled objects. The author of the project posts 1 creative idea [per day in a chronological order. The only way to get access and acquire these images is by vising project social media pages or the project offical website.

I was just thinking a way to download these photos into my local image repository and enjoy as wallpaper and so on. So, why not analyze the site structure and try to scrap these images for inspiration. I think the author might not mind for personal use of these images since these images have been sharing across social media.
