title: New Era of Word Processors

When I was started using computer, MS Office suite is the first application suite I was learned to practice my typing skills and how to write electronic documents. I believe every one knows how to use at least one word processor. After I switched to Linux, I gave up on MS Office and trying to adapt with open source solutions for my writing task. Openoffice and LibreOffice becomes the primary word processors. For working in several computers and collaborative works, I use Google Docs that can avoid version control and maintaining files offline. I know there is MS Office Online but it looks awful and incomplete. For free Writing tasks, I use any text editors with markdown format. 

For writing tasks that need to follow a particular layout and format, it's still a tedious task. For e.g. people still sharing MS Word file since they assume everyone using MS Word. Compatibility is a big issue. Importing Google Docs or another open source programs breaks the layout.Even MS Office and MS Office Online are not 100% compatible. Exporting Google Docs to MS Office also fails. It's more like you start with one, you sticks to it until the end. 

I was wishing a better solution to avoid this headache. Writing should be easy. Word processors should be distraction free. I want a software that help me to write without unnecessary tedious tasks. 
MS Office for Linux? 
Better MS Word format support on other programs? 
Just reinvented the whole system?
A standard format to share electronic written document?

### Dropbox paper

Dropbox announces a new side product called Paper and I read a <a href="https://www.designernews.co/stories/59698-i-tried-dropbox-paper-and-i-loved-it">designernews post</a>about it. It mentions another online processor called Notion. Future of word processors? I thoght it can be.. These 2 new word processors look elegant and promising. Both of the products are in early stage and also against traditional word processing platforms. No menu bars. No distracted ruler and margins. Integration is easy and share directly via email address.
