I am an expat living in Bangkok and rely on public transportation to avoid high traffic of Bangkok. I like to read/think and text during the daily commute to the office. As for commuting to a destination disconnected to train or bus, I have to use public taxi to get there. Lately, I've been using Uber instead of public taxi service for these reasons:

* Communication problem with taxi driver. Language barrier.
* Tricky taxi driver driving around the unnecessary route.
* Refusing to go to some high-traffic destination.
* Comfort.
* Safety.
