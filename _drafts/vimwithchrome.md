This is just another ordinary day of reading news and looking for cool stuffs on Github and run into this repo called [SurfingKeys](https://github.com/brookhong/Surfingkeys). It's a keyboard-based navigation mappings for Google Chrome inspired by VIM modes. I am a dedicated user of Google Chrome and also uses VIM as default terminal editor and decided to try this cool idea. Even though the developer has a very good documentation, I would like to highlight some useful features and keys for starters users by use-case scenario. 

Few things that don't work with SurfingKeys:
1. Plug-ins that control your Chrome tabs. (The Great Suspender,Panda...)
2. 

### Help

Help is the first thing to check via **u** or **?** (make sure the focus is on browser window). **se** to get to the SurfingKeys settings.


### Tabs and Page Navigation

Tabs navigation can be a lot easier without going to the URL bar and click it. Here is a list of key to explore:

#### Tabs Navigation

- **T** to see all open tabs and type corresponding alphabet to navigate
- **E** to navigate to left tab of current tab and **R** to navigate to right tab of current tab
- **on** to spawn a new tab
- **x** to close current tab
- **X** to restore closed tab
- **<<** shift active tab to left
- **>>** shift active tab to right
- **su** to edit current tab's URL


#### Page Navigation

- **d** to scroll the web page down
- **e** to scroll the web page up
- **j** scroll down
- **k** scroll up
- **0** scroll to left
- **$** scroll to right
- **r** reload page

### Manipulating URLs

Let's say you want to open a new URL or open a link from the current tab to new tabs. These keys will help.

**f** will shows all URLs of the active page and open in current tab
**af** and **gf** also do similar job as **f** but open in new tab
**alt-f** to open multiple URLs in new tabs (very useful)

### Search & Edit
These keys are useful when you want to search within a web page and ed
    
- **/** to search within a web page
- ***** to find a selected text with current page
- **v** to change into visual mode and a visual caret will appear
- **n** to jump to next found text
- **N** to jump to previous found text

### Copy/Paste & more
After selecting text from the page, these keys might help to copy and paste with ease:
