Have you ever wondered how to grab all the Google fonts on your machine? Now,you can do it easily with a bash script. For Mac system,it can be done with the first script and I contributed another script for Debian system. For people who wants to contribute for other platforms such as Windows,take a look at this github <a href="https://github.com/qrpike/Web-Font-Load" target="_blank">repo</a>. 

{%highlight bash%}
#Mac
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qrpike/Web-Font-Load/master/install.sh 
#Debian systems
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qrpike/Web-Font-Load/master/install_debian.sh
