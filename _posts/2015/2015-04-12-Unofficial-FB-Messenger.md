### Offical Facebook Messenger

Last week, Facebook announces its messenging platform for web and you can log in <a href="https://www.messenger.com/login" target="_blank">here</a>.I was not really impressive with the look and also have a security concern about 'shoulder surfing' since it is really easy to read full screen chatbox from a certain distinct.

I believe people from Facebook should develop a native application for all major platforms (Windows,Mac, Linux). It will happen in sonner or later but still disappointing.

### Unofficial Facebook Messenger
Before I decidede to write this blog, I just ran into a github project called <a href="https://github.com/Aluxian/Facebook-Messenger-Desktop" target="_blank">Facebook-Messenger-Desktop</a>. It brings messenger web services to your desktop and it is implemented in Node.js. It's still in active development and Node developers should contribute to make it better.

For end-users, you can use it by downlading corresponding pre-compiled executables for your platform at <a href="https://pnd.gs/a/nII6E3gZkdnE1+oyOSo8LUbQyBT2DaX+NX7M1cVC/i8=" target="_blank">Messenger for Desktop</a>.
