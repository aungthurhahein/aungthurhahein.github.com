<a href="http://themerapp.com/" target="_blank">Themer</a> is a theme platform that android veterans are looking for. It was started as a closed source,so I didn't have a chance to try it. 
Waiting for invitation code and it didn't come to my inbox. 

Now,no more invitation and you can download it at GPlay Store and it won't let you down. It is still in Beta and a little glitch in widget customization. However,the rest of the feature is killing.
