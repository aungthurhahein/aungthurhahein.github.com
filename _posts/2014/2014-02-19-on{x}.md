I am a big fan of <a href="https://ifttt.com/wtf" target="_blank">ifttt</a> and many recipes used from that service to automate my tedious Internet tasks and activities. 

I am expecting a mobile app that provides similar services. There is an android app called Tasker but not that intelligence and still needs room for improvement. 

Surprisingly, the one which works similar to ifttt is the app called <a href="https://www.onx.ms" target="_blank">on{X}</a> from Microsoft. 

It can automate the tasks according to your need and you can code your desired automated tasks by calling device apis and functions. It is still in beta and have lots of known issues.

Check it out coders with android gadgets.
You might love it or.....lose it.
