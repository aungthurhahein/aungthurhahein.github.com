Gnome terminal is a default terminal application for Ubuntu distro and I love its simplicity and consistency. I've been wondering today that how can I change the color scheme without changing color platte one by one. 

My curiosity is fuilfilled by this github repo: <a href="https://github.com/Anthony25/gnome-terminal-colors-solarized" target="_blank">gnome-terminal-colors-solarized</a>.

Installtion is simple and straightforwards. There is 3 color plattes to choose from. 

Hope I can contribute to insert more nice color plattes in the near future. 

Updated:
After I look though github repos, I saw several projects related with this and ddecided to make a <a href="https://github.com/aungthurhahein/Colorful-Terminal" target="_blank">curation</a> of them.
